Quickstart for creating a Roblox exploit with the C# WeAreDevs API  
https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API  

*You can find the built/exported .exe in the "/release" folder  

*WeAreDevs_API.dll must always be in the same folder as your built .exe file  

*When sharing with friends, I would build in x86 release mode
